Ahoy!! I'm `vereis`!

I'm a London-based `Software Engineer` and `Tech Lead` currently working at [Vetspire](https://vetspire.com), where we're helping vets reclaim their time -- because they should focus on what they love, not fighting bad software!

I graduated from the [University of Kent](https://kent.ac.uk) with a degree in `Computer Science` and got started programming at age seven via [GameMaker](https://www.yoyogames.com/gamemaker).

## Technology

I see myself more as a `problem solver` than a `programmer`: its less about the code and more about figuring out how to solve the problem at hand.

My go-to tech stack includes:

- [Elixir](https://elixir-lang.org)
- [Erlang](https://erlang.org)
- [Nix](https://nixos.org)

I also "live in the terminal" and generally dislike GUI based tools or workflows.

My go-to tools include:

- [Neovim](https://neovim.io)
- [Qutebrowser](https://qutebrowser.org)
- [Zellij](https://zellij.dev)
- [ranger](https://ranger.github.io)
- [gh](https://cli.github.com)

I also use all three major operating systems regularly (Windows, macOS, and Linux), but develop primarily for Linux-based systems.

## Keyboards

I'm particularly fond of old IBM Models M and F, and keyboards with a HHKB layout.

I daily drive a `HHKB Pro 2` w/ JIS keycaps, and a custom `F62 Kishsaver` with a HHKB layout.

## Personal

My hobbies include:

- `Tea` particularly `pu'erh` or `white` teas.
- `Perfume` especially `oud`, `floral`, or `spicy` scents.
- `Cooking` I've been an avid home cook and something of a foodie for years.

## Blog

I'm trying to write better and more often. I mainly write about tech but also rarely about more personal things.

See [blog](/posts) for things I've written!

Opinions & views are my own and not reflective of my employer!!
