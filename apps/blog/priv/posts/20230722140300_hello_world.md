Ahoy!! I'm `vereis`!

I have a long history of working on distributed systems using [Erlang](https://erlang.org) and [Elixir](https://elixir-lang.org).

I'm currently a London-based `Tech Lead` trying to make save veterinarians time so they can focus on what they do best: helping animals.

In my spare time I enjoy cooking, eating, and drinking tea!

## Background

I'm a self-taught develop who got started with game development when I was 7 years old.

I started with [GameMaker](https://www.yoyogames.com/gamemaker) where I (very inefficiently) taught myself how to code.

I've since dabbled in a variety of languages and frameworks, primarily focused on web development or systems programming.

Nowadays, my go-to tech stack includes:

- [Elixir](https://elixir-lang.org)
- [Erlang](https://erlang.org)
- [PostgreSQL](https://postgresql.org) or [SQLite](https://sqlite.org)
- [Svelte](https://svelte.dev)
- [Tailscale](https://tailscale.com)
- [Nix](https://nixos.org)

I've been a longtime member of the [ricing](https://reddit.com/r/unixporn) community, which still regularly inspires me to optimize my workflow and environment.

## Stuff I Use

I keep an up-to-date list of hardware, software, services, and hobbies that vibe with me on [my uses](/uses) page.

A lot of people ask, so tl;dr:

- [NixOS](https://nixos.org)
- [NeoVim](https://neovim.io)
- [QuteBrowser](https://qutebrowser.org)
- [Dotfiles](https://github.com/vereis/nix-config)
