Ahoy!! I'm `vereis`!

I'm a London-based `Technical Lead` currently working at [Vetspire](https://vetspire.com), where we're helping vets reclaim their time -- because they should focus on what they love, not fighting bad software!

I read Computer Science [University of Kent](https://kent.ac.uk) between 2014 and 2018, before joining [Erlang Solutions](https://erlang-solutions.com) as a consultant.

I strongly believe that software should be a craft, that software should be minimal, and that software should be free.

## Background

I got into programming when I was 7 where I started with [GameMaker](https://www.yoyogames.com/gamemaker) where I very inefficiently taught myself how to code.

Nowadays, my go-to tech stack includes:

- [Elixir](https://elixir-lang.org)
- [Erlang](https://erlang.org)
- [PostgreSQL](https://postgresql.org) or [SQLite](https://sqlite.org)
- [Svelte](https://svelte.dev)
- [Tailscale](https://tailscale.com)
- [Nix](https://nixos.org)

I have familiarity with developing software on all three major operating systems (Windows, macOS, and Linux), but develop primarily for Linux-based systems. I'm also comfortable with tools like [Cygwin](https://cygwin.com).

## Stuff I Use and Like

I keep an up-to-date list of hardware, software, services, and hobbies I use and like on my [uses](/uses) page.

I'm always looking for new things to try, so if you have any recommendations, feel free to let me know!

## Blog & Projects

I keep a collection of thoughts and ideas on my [blog](/posts). I mainly write about software but will occasionally write about other things that interest me.

You can additionally see a list of [projects](/projects) I've worked on or contributed to.

## Contact

I mainly go by `vereis` online. Connect with me via:

- [GitHub](https://github.com/vereis)
- [Steam](https://steamcommunity.com/id/vereis)
- [BlueSky](https://bsky.app/profile/vereis.com)
- [Email](mailto:contact@vereis.com)
- [Discord](@vereis)

I've also gone by `Lacrymis` in certain video games such as:

- [TERA](https://tera.enmasse.com)
- [Eden Eternal](https://edeneternal.aeriagames.com)
- [Aura Kingdom](https://aurakingdom.aeriagames.com)
