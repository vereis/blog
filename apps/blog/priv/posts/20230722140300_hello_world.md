Ahoy!! I'm `vereis`!

I'm a London-based `Software Engineer` and `Tech Lead` currently working at [Vetspire](https://vetspire.com), where we're trying to give vets their time back so they can focus on what they love instead of bad software.

I got into programming when I was seven by making games in [GameMaker](https://www.yoyogames.com/gamemaker) and have been hooked ever since!

I graduated from the [University of Kent](https://kent.ac.uk) with a degree in `Computer Science` and am interested in natural computation & distributed systems.

## Tech

My go-to stack is:

- [Elixir](https://elixir-lang.org)
- [Erlang](https://erlang.org)
- [Tailscale](https://tailscale.com)
- [Nix](https://nixos.org)

Technologies I'm comfortable with include, but are not limited to:

- [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com)
- [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io)
- [React](https://reactjs.org)
- [Svelte](https://svelte.dev)

I'm a huge fan of [neovim](https://neovim.org) and pretty much live entirely in the terminal. You can see my [config here](https://github.com/vereis/nix-config/tree/master/modules/home/neovim/lua).

## Personal

I've been into `tea` and `perfume` for a long time. I'm a big fan of `pu'erh` teas in particular and love fragrances with `oud`, `floral`, or `spicy` notes.

Cooking and eating are also big hobbies of mine -- I travel to eat!!

### Keyboards

I'm a big keyboard enthusiast and collector. The majority of my keyboards are various IBM Models Ms and Fs.

Holy grail: [Heavy Grail \(Ghost of Christmas Future\)](https://www.norbauer.co/products/the-heavy-grail-ghost-of-christmas-future-edition).

My daily rotation consists of:

- `HHKB Pro 2` in Black w/ salvaged JIS keycaps from a `Realforce 87U`.
- `HHKB Pro 2` in Beige w/ aftermarket JIS keycaps.
- `HHKB Hybrid` in Beige w/ stock keycaps.
- `Keychron Q60` which is a great HHKB "clone".
- `F62 Kishsaver` with the HHKB layout.
- `IBM Model M` bolt modded w/ blank keycaps.
- `Dell AT101W` with Salmon Alps.

### Books

I primarily use [Audible](https://audible.co.uk) for audiobooks, or just read PDFs on my [ReMarkable](https://remarkable.com).

This year I took it upon myself to re-read a bunch of childhood favourites such as:

- [Harry Potter](https://www.audible.co.uk/series/Harry-Potter-Audiobooks/B017V4IM8I)
- [Twilight](https://www.audible.co.uk/series/Twilight-Saga-Audiobooks/B00B1V5JZI)
- [The Hunger Games](https://www.audible.co.uk/series/The-Hunger-Games-Audiobooks/B00B1V5JZI)


Favourite non-fiction books include:

- [Crafting Interpreters](https://craftinginterpreters.com)
- [Learn You Some Erlang](https://learnyousomeerlang.com)
- Anything by [Dawkins](https://www.richarddawkins.net) or [Hitchens](https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/3958/Christopher_Hitchens)

I'm currently reading [The Staff Engineer's Path](https://staffeng.com) and I'm finishing up [The Expanse](https://www.audible.co.uk/series/The-Expanse-Audiobooks/B00B1V5JZI).

### TV

I'm a big fan of `sci-fi` and `period` TV shows. Nothing will ever beat the [Stargate](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0118480/) universe, but some other favourites of mine include:

- [The Expanse](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt3230854/)
- [Brigerton](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt8740790/)
