> This is the first in what will hopefully be a series about applications I use and want to share.

I spend most of my day in a terminal, controlling my computer with a keyboard.

If you're similar, you probably know the slightly jarring experience of switching to a traditional web browser — suddenly you're in a world of mouse-driven interfaces that feels disconnected from your usual workflow.

## The Browser Problem

Most browsers today are optimized for the average user, which means:

- **Mouse-first navigation** with lots of UI chrome
- **Limited customization** beyond basic settings
- **Sync-everything mentality** that often requires accounts
- **Feature creep** with AI assistants, reading modes, and productivity tools

This doesn't align well with how I prefer to work. I want something more minimal.

## Enter Qutebrowser

[Qutebrowser](https://qutebrowser.org/) is a keyboard-driven, vim-like browser with a minimal GUI.

It follows similar principles to tools like `neovim` and `dwm`: modal editing, text-based configuration, and getting out of your way.

### Why Not Firefox or Chrome?

Don't get me wrong — Firefox and Chrome are solid browsers. But they have some friction points for keyboard-heavy workflows:

- **Mouse-centric design** — keyboard shortcuts exist, but the UX assumes you're clicking
- **Extension dependency** — tools like Vimium help, but you're working against the grain
- **Configuration complexity** — customizing beyond basic preferences can be painful
- **Feature accumulation** — Pocket, sponsored shortcuts, AI features that I don't really need

Qutebrowser takes a different approach. It's built from the ground up for keyboard navigation and comes pretty minimal out of the box.

> Qutebrowser runs on [QtWebEngine](https://doc.qt.io/qt-6/qtwebengine-index.html), so web compatibility is generally excellent.
>
> Chrome extensions don't work, but you can use [Greasemonkey](https://www.greasespot.net/) scripts and Python-based userscripts instead.

## Core Features

Here are some of the core features that make Qutebrowser stand out.

### Modal Editing

Qutebrowser uses a modal editing paradigm similar to `vim`, where you can switch between different modes for different tasks.

The main thing is that the entire browser, and thus most well written websites, can be navigated using the keyboard.

When you launch Qutebrowser, you start in **normal mode** where you can navigate using vim-style keys.

Basic navigation includes:

| Command | Action |
| --------| ------- |
| `j`/`k` | Scroll|
| `h`/`l` | History |
| `o`/`O` | Open URL |
| `J`/`K` | Switch Tab |
| `yy` | Copy URL to Clipboard |

You can switch modes via the following commands:

| Command | Action |
| ------- | ------ |
| `f`/`F` | Hints Mode |
| `i` | Insert Mode |
| `v` | Caret Mode |
| `:` | Command Mode |
| `?` | Find Mode |
| `C-v` | Passthrough Mode |

When you're in `hints` mode, letters appear over links and you can type the letter to follow the link like below:

![image](../images/qutebrowser_hints.webp)
> _Here, typing `js` would click the first search result._

When you're in `insert` mode, you can type text into the page like a normal text editor. Usually focusing on an input element will do this for you.

Lastly, when you're in `passthrough` mode, Qutebrowser's normal keybindings are disabled, and you can type freely into the page as if you were using a regular browser.

The other modes are more self-explanatory, but you can find more details in:

- [Settings documentation](https://qutebrowser.org/doc/help/settings.html).
- [Commands documentation](https://qutebrowser.org/doc/help/commands.html).

### Search Engines, Quickmarks, and Bookmarks

You can configure search engines and quickmarks in your `config.py`.

Search engines work like this:

```python
c.url.searchengines = {
  'DEFAULT': 'https://google.com/search?q={}',
  'aw': 'https://wiki.archlinux.org/?search={}',
  'gh': 'https://github.com/search?q={}',
  'yt': 'https://youtube.com/results?search_query={}',
}
```

Then typing `:o aw nixos` will search for `nixos` on the Arch Wiki. Pretty handy.

Quickmarks are like bookmarks but better — you can name them and fuzzy search.

Add one with `:quickmark-add https://example.com test`, then open it by:

1. Running `:quickmark-load test`
2. Using `o`/`O` and fuzzy searching for `test`

The command mode gives you a nice fuzzy-finder that searches through URLs, quickmarks, and commands:

![image](../images/qutebrowser_commands.webp)
> _You can start typing to filter the list, and hit `Enter` to execute the command._

> I prefer quickmarks over regular bookmarks since you can give them meaningful names and search for them easily.

Normal bookmarks exist too, but I don't really use them.

Check the [command docs](https://qutebrowser.org/doc/help/commands.html) for the full list of what's possible.

### Built-in Adblocking

Qutebrowser supports two types of adblocking:

1. **Hosts-based Adblocking**
2. **Brave's Adblock Lists**

Adblocking is enabled by default and works well out of the box.

```python
c.content.blocking.method = 'both'  # Uses both hosts and adblock lists
c.content.blocking.adblock.lists = [
  'https://easylist.to/easylist/easylist.txt',
  'https://easylist.to/easylist/easyprivacy.txt',
]
```

On first run, you might need to run `:adblock-update` to download the lists.

> The defaults work fine for most sites, but hosts-based blocking isn't perfect. YouTube ads, for example, are served from the same domains as the content, so they slip through.
>
> You can work around this with Greasemonkey scripts, or set up a keybind to open videos in `mpv`:
>
> ```python
> config.bind(',m', 'spawn mpv {url}')
> config.bind(',M', 'hint links spawn mpv {hint-url}')
> ```
>
> Honestly though, I just pay for YouTube Premium. It's worth it.

### Per Site Javascript and Styling

Back in the day, I used to use [NoScript](https://noscript.net/) to block JavaScript on a per-site basis.

I don't rely on this very much anymore, but Qutebrowser supports this too.

You can use the configuration file to run [Greasemonkey](https://www.greasespot.net/) scripts, or disable JavaScript on a per-site basis.

```python
c.content.javascript.enabled = True  # Enable JavaScript by default
c.content.javascript.can_access_clipboard = False  # Disable clipboard access
```

You may find it useful to disable JavaScript on the fly for certain sites, which you can do with the following command:

```python
config.set('content.javascript.enabled', False, 'https://example.com')
```

If you're familiar with `Greasemonkey` scripts, you can use them to basically inject and run JavaScript on demand.

> There isn't a built-in UI for managing your scripts, but Qutebrowser will read all files matching `<qutebrowser_dir>/greasemonkey/*.js`

There's an [official guide](https://qutebrowser.org/doc/userscripts.html) which might prove helpful too, and this is briefly covered
in the [FAQ](https://qutebrowser.org/doc/faq.html).

### Keybindings

The magic of Qutebrowser lies in its keybindings.

All of the supported commands can be bound to keys, and can be toggled or executed on the fly as needed.

I keep my configuration pretty minimal, but it's useful to toggle features with keybinds.

```python
config.bind('<Ctrl+Shift+s>', 'session-save')
config.bind('<Ctrl+Shift+l>', 'session-load')
config.bind('<Ctrl+Shift+a>', 'adblock-toggle')
config.bind('<Ctrl+Shift+j>', 'config-cycle content.javascript.enabled')
```

The session save/load commands are particularly handy for deterministic tab management.

> I prefer using `:session-save` and `:session-load` over something like Chrome's "restore tabs" feature, because its deterministic and simple.
>
> Qutebrowser will, however, restore the last session automatically on startup, so you don't have to worry about losing your tabs.

## Installation

Qutebrowser is packaged for most platforms, so installation is usually straightforward.

### Linux

Most distributions have qutebrowser in their repos:

```sh
sudo apt install qutebrowser
sudo pacman -S qutebrowser
sudo dnf install qutebrowser
sudo zypper install qutebrowser
```

### macOS

The easiest way is via [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/):

```sh
brew install qutebrowser
```

### Windows

You can install via [winget](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/package-manager/winget/):

```sh
winget install qutebrowser.qutebrowser
```

Or download the installer from the [releases page](https://github.com/qutebrowser/qutebrowser/releases).

### NixOS

I use [home-manager](https://github.com/nix-community/home-manager) to manage qutebrowser:

```nix
programs.qutebrowser = {
  enable = true;
  settings = {
    url.searchengines = {
      DEFAULT = "https://kagi.com/search?q={}";
      gh = "https://github.com/search?q={}";
      aw = "https://wiki.archlinux.org/?search={}";
    };
  };
};
```

> You can see my full config in [my dotfiles](https://github.com/vereis/nix-config/tree/master/modules/home).

### First Run

On first launch, qutebrowser will create a config directory and prompt you to run `:adblock-update` to download blocklists.

The config directory locations are:
- **Linux**: `~/.config/qutebrowser/`
- **macOS**: `~/.qutebrowser/`
- **Windows**: `%APPDATA%/qutebrowser/`

### DRM Content (Netflix, etc.)

For DRM-protected content, you'll need Widevine support:

- **Arch Linux**: Install `qutebrowser-widevine` from the AUR.
- **NixOS**: set `enableWidevine = true` in your qutebrowser package override.
- **Other distributions**: You'll need to manually patch the widevine library. The process varies by distro, so search for your specific setup.

> You can easily enable Widevine support in NixOS by overriding the qutebrowser package in your `home.nix` or `configuration.nix`:
> ```nix
> programs.qutebrowser.package = pkgs.qutebrowser.override {
>   enableWidevine = true;
> };
> ```

## Configuration Tips

Once you get qutebrowser running, there are some quality-of-life improvements worth setting up.

### Themes and Appearance

Qutebrowser doesn't come with many built-in themes, but you can customize colors and fonts in your `config.py`:

```python
# Rose Pine theme (my current setup)
c.colors.completion.fg = '#e0def4'
c.colors.completion.odd.bg = '#26233a'
c.colors.completion.even.bg = '#191724'
c.colors.completion.category.fg = '#9ccfd8'
c.colors.completion.item.selected.bg = '#31748f'

# Or just use a darker background
c.colors.webpage.darkmode.enabled = True
c.colors.webpage.darkmode.policy.images = 'never'
```

### Useful Keybinds

Beyond the basics, these are handy:

```python
config.bind(',d', 'download-open')
config.bind(',i', 'devtools')
config.bind(',D', 'config-cycle colors.webpage.darkmode.enabled')
```

### Userscripts

Qutebrowser ships with some useful userscripts. For example, you can use `qute-pass` to manage passwords:

```python
config.bind(',p', 'spawn --userscript qute-pass')
config.bind(',P', 'spawn --userscript qute-pass --username-only')
```

You'll need [pass](https://www.passwordstore.org/) and potentially [dmenu](https://tools.suckless.org/dmenu/) set up for this to work.

## Common Issues

Here are some problems you might run into and how to fix them.

### Sites That Don't Work

Some sites are broken or annoying in qutebrowser:

- Certain sites might block Qutebrowser's user-agent, but you can change it in your config.
- Certain heavier web apps (like Google Docs) may not work well due. I don't run into these often though.

You can change the user-agent like this:

```python
c.content.headers.user_agent = 'Mozilla/5.0 (X11; Linux x86_64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/58.0.3029.110 Safari/537.3'
```

And honestly, I just use non-web apps for most of my work anyway, so I don't run into these issues often. If you do, see if the app has a native client or use a different browser for those specific sites.

### Clipboard Integration

If copy/paste doesn't work properly on Linux, you might need `xclip` or `wl-clipboard` installed depending on your setup.

This should work out of the box on Windows, and macOS.

## Conclusion

Qutebrowser is a powerful, keyboard-driven browser that prioritizes simplicity, privacy, and customization that gets out of your way.

If you want to better align and control your web browsing experience, especially if the rest of your workflow is keyboard-driven, I highly recommend giving Qutebrowser a try.

There are some alternatives like:

- [Nyxt](https://www.nytx.org/) which is Lisp-based and seems super powerful.
- [Surf](https://surf.suckless.org/) which is a minimal web browser based on WebKit.

There are extensions for other browsers that try to enable more keyboard-driven navigation, but the [WebExtensions API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Add-ons/WebExtensions) is not as flexible and often aren't as fully featured.

If you're interested in using extensions, you might want to look into:

- [Tridactyl](https://github.com/tridactyl/tridactyl)
- [Vimium](https://vimium.github.io/)

I'd recommend the following further reading if you're interested in Qutebrowser:

- [r/qutebrowser](https://www.reddit.com/r/qutebrowser/)

Hopefully, this post has given you a good overview of Qutebrowser and why I use it.
