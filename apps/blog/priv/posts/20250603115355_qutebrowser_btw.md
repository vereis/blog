I spent most of my day using a terminal and controlling my computer with a keyboard.

If, like me, you do this too, you might feel like stepping into a traditional web browser feels like stepping into a different universe.

## Qutebrowser

Modern web browsers are designed for the average user prioritizing cursor driven navigation, aren't particularly customizable, and are generally bloated with features you don't need.

This is what I'm looking for in a web browser:

- **Keyboard driven** - let me navigate using my keyboard.
- **Customizable** - let me script, control, and theme the browser to my liking.
- **Privacy** - don't track me, don't make me sign in, don't collect my data.

Enter [Qutebrowser](https://qutebrowser.org/), a keyboard-driven, vim-like browser with a minimal GUI.

Qutebrowser is a browser that embraces modal editing, text-based configuration, and minimalism, much like:

- [neovim](https://neovim.io/)
- [dwm](https://dwm.suckless.org/)

### Why Qutebrowser?

Most browsers optimize for:

- **Mouse Users**
    - UI components include tab bars, omniboxes, and nested menus.
    - Configuration is often done via a GUI like `about:preferences`.
- **Vendor Lock-in**
    - Browsers often require you to sign in to sync bookmarks, history, and settings.
    - They may also push you towards their own ecosystem of extensions and services.
- **Feature Bloat**
    - [Pocket](https://getpocket.com/), to no one's surprise, is being sunset.
    - AI Integrations, which I really don't want or need.
- **Anti Features**
    - [Brave](https://brave.com/)'s crypto stuff, which I don't want.
    - Browsers making it hard to switch default search engines.
    - Chrome implementing [Manifest V3](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/mv3/intro/), which breaks many extensions and limits ad-blocking capabilities.

Qutebrowser doesn't do any of this. It literally comes minimally configured out of the box and literally just lets you browse the web.

> To be entirely fair, Qutebrowser runs on top of [QtWebEngine](https://doc.qt.io/qt-6/qtwebengine-index.html).
>
> Plugins and extensions from Chrome don't work though, the plugins are usually [Greasemonkey](https://www.greasespot.net/) or [Python](https://www.python.org/) scripts that get loaded into the browser.

## Core Features

Here are some of the core features that make Qutebrowser stand out.

### Modal Editing

Qutebrowser uses a modal editing paradigm similar to `vim`, where you can switch between different modes for different tasks.

The main thing is that the entire browser, and thus most well written websites, can be navigated using the keyboard.

When you launch Qutebrowser, you start in **normal mode** where you can navigate using `h`, `j`, `k`, and `l` keys, similar to `vim`.

Basic navigation in Qutebrowser's `normal` mode includes:

| Command | Action |
| --------| ------- |
| `j`/`k` | Scroll|
| `h`/`l` | History |
| `o`/`O` | Open URL |
| `J`/`K` | Switch Tab |

You can switch modes via the following commands:

| Command | Action |
| ------- | ------ |
| `f`/`F` | Hints Mode |
| `i` | Insert Mode |
| `v` | Caret Mode |
| `:` | Command Mode |
| `?` | Find Mode |
| `C-v` | Passthrough Mode |

When you're in `hints` mode, letters appear over links and you can type the letter to follow the link like below:

> _Here, typing `js` would click the first search result._

When you're in `insert` mode, you can type text into the page like a normal text editor. Usually focusing on an input element will do this for you.

Lastly, when you're in `passthrough` mode, Qutebrowser's normal keybindings are disabled, and you can type freely into the page as if you were using a regular browser.

The other modes are more self-explanatory, but you can find more details in the [Qutebrowser documentation](https://qutebrowser.org/doc/).

### Search Engines and Quickmarks

You can configure Qutebrowser's search engines and quickmarks in the `qutebrowser.conf` file.

You can add search engines like this:

```python
c.url.searchengines = {
  'DEFAULT': 'https://google.com/search?q={}',
  'aw': 'https://wiki.archlinux.org/?search={}',
  'gh': 'https://github.com/search?q={}',
  'yt': 'https://youtube.com/results?search_query={}',
}
```

And trying to open a URL like `:o aw nixos` will search for `nixos` on the Arch Wiki, for example.

Quickmarks are similar, but are likewise, keyboard driven.

You can add quickmarks by running `:quickmark-add test https://example.com`, and then you can open it by typing `:open test`.

Whenever you're in `command` mode, you get a little fuzzy-finder UI that pops up, letting you search for URLs, quickmarks, and commands like so:

![image](../images/qutebrowser_commands.webp)
> _You can start typing to filter the list, and hit `Enter` to execute the command._

Normal bookmarks can be defined too, please refer to the [Qutebrowser documentation](https://qutebrowser.org/doc/) for more details.

### Built-in Adblocking

Qutebrowser supports two types of adblocking:

1. **Hosts-based Adblocking**
2. **Brave's Adblock Lists**

The adblocker is enabled by default, and you can configure it in the `qutebrowser.conf` file.

```python
c.content.blocking.method = 'both'  # Uses both hosts and adblock lists
c.content.blocking.adblock.lists = [
  'https://easylist.to/easylist/easylist.txt',
  'https://easylist.to/easylist/easyprivacy.txt',
]
```

When booting Qutebrowser for the first time, it might prompt you to run `:adblock-update` to download initial adblock lists.

> I use the default configuration for adblocking which works perfectly fine for me.
>
> You can add custom adblock lists or modify the existing ones as per your needs both via a command, or by editing the configuration.

### Per Site Javascript and Styling

Back in the day, I used to use [NoScript](https://noscript.net/) to block JavaScript on a per-site basis.

I don't rely on this very much anymore, but Qutebrowser supports this too.

You can use the configuration file to run [Greasemonkey](https://www.greasespot.net/) scripts, or disable JavaScript on a per-site basis.

```python
c.content.javascript.enabled = True  # Enable JavaScript by default
c.content.javascript.can_access_clipboard = False  # Disable clipboard access
```

You may find it useful to disable JavaScript on the fly for certain sites, which you can do with the following command:

```python
config.set('content.javascript.enabled', False, 'https://example.com')
```

If you're familiar with `Greasemonkey` scripts, you can use them to basically inject and run JavaScript on demand.

### Keybindings

The magic of Qutebrowser lies in its keybindings.

All of the supported commands can be bound to keys, and can be toggled or executed on the fly as needed.

I keep my configuration very basic, but it's super useful to be able to toggle adblocking, JavaScript, and other features with a single keypress.

```python
c.bindings.key_mappings = {
  'Ctrl+Shift+S': 'session-save',
  'Ctrl+Shift+L': 'session-load',
  'Ctrl+Shift+A': 'adblock-toggle',
  'Ctrl+Shift+J': 'javascript-toggle',
}
```

I also have keybindings set targeting the `:session-save` and `:session-load` commands, which let me save and restore my browsing sessions easily.

> I prefer using `:session-save` and `:session-load` over something like Chrome's "restore tabs" feature, because its deterministic and simple.
>
> Qutebrowser will, however, restore the last session automatically on startup, so you don't have to worry about losing your tabs.

## Limitations

Qutebrowser is not without its limitations, and it's important to be aware of them. It certainly isn't for everyone.

If you're looking for a Chromium alternative, then Qutebrowser is not for you.

If you're a heavy user of extensions, Qutebrowser may not be the best fit either.

DRM content is supported by patching a `widevine` library into the browser, which seems to work for me, but doing this seems complicated (if you're not using `Nix` like me).

There are also definitely some CSS rendering quirks that either don't bother me, or I can live with.

## Conclusion

Qutebrowser is a powerful, keyboard-driven browser that prioritizes simplicity, privacy, and customization that gets out of your way.

If you want to better align and control your web browsing experience, especially if the rest of your workflow is keyboard-driven, I highly recommend giving Qutebrowser a try.

There are some alternatives like:

- [Nyxt](https://www.nytx.org/) which is Lisp-based and seems super powerful.
- [Tridactyl](https://github.com/tridactyl/tridactyl) which is Vim for Firefox.
- [Surf](https://surf.suckless.org/) which is a minimal web browser based on WebKit.

I'd recommend the following further reading if you're interested in Qutebrowser:

- [r/qutebrowser](https://www.reddit.com/r/qutebrowser/)

Hopefully, this post has given you a good overview of Qutebrowser and why I use it.
