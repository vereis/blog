Like most people, I started my computing journey on Windows.

I heard about Linux in middle school, but was honestly completely happy with Windows and never looked into it.

That all changed when a friend introduced me to:

1. [bblean](https://bb4win.sourceforge.net/bblean/)
2. [rainmeter](https://www.rainmeter.net/)
3. [cygwin](https://www.cygwin.com/)

I fell deep into the `ricing` community, run mainly on [deviantart](https://www.deviantart.com/) at the time, and I started to learn about Linux.

> It originated from the car culture, where "ricing" refers to modifying a car for aesthetics rather than performance.

While `cygwin` was great, eventually I jumped ship to Linux proper and became a terminal distro hopper.

Circa June 2020, I was between projects at my job and a co-worker was talking about [nix](https://nixos.org/) and I was intruiged.

After a few false starts, needless to say I was hooked.

## Goals

Unlike a lot of posts out there commending `nix`, I'm by no means an expert.

Theoretically, I barely know enough `nix` to be dangerous... but I have used `nix` in anger for a few years now and I think I have a pretty good grasp _why_ I like it.

If you're looking for a deep dive into `nix`, this post isn't for you, but do check out:

- [Nix Language Guide](https://nix.dev/tutorials/nix-language)
- [The Nix Pills](https://nixos.org/guides/nix-pills/)

In my experience, you can get away with using `nix` without knowing much about the language itself, and I think that's a pretty good thing.

So, let's talk about `nix`!

## What is Nix?

In short, `nix` is a set of tools that solve a lot of problems!

One problem it doesn't solve is being clearly defined, as "nix" can refer to:

1. [a package manager](https://github.com/NixOS/nix)
2. [a package repo](https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs)
3. [a language](https://nix.dev/manual/nix/2.24/language)
4. [an operating system](https://nixos.org/)
5. ...

> For the purposes of this post, I'll try to be clear about which one of these I'm talking about!
>
> If its not clear, reach out and I'll edit this post to clarify!

## Installation

If you want to install NixOS, you can do so via the [NixOS installation guide](https://nixos.org/manual/nixos/stable/index.html#sec-installation).

You can do the same thing for `nix`, but this might cause issues on MacOS and requires some configuration.

I recommend this [installer](https://determinate.systems/nix-installer/) instead, which:

1. is the easiest way to install `nix` on MacOS.
2. fixes a lot of MacOS specific issues with the default installer.
3. opts into experimental features by default, which is widely recommended.

> See [this post](https://determinate.systems/posts/experimental-does-not-mean-unstable/) for more information on why you should enable experimental features.

> This post will assume you have the experimental features enabled, but if you don't, you can always enable them later.

## The Nix Package Manager

The `nix` package manager is a CLI tool that allows you to install and manage packages on your system.

You can think about `nix` as being an equivalent to `brew` or `apt`, but with a few key differences:

1. **Functional:** There is "no global state" to mutate.
2. **Declarative:** You can define your system configuration in a file.
3. **Cross-platform:** It works on Linux, Mac, and Windows (via WSL).

The term "package manager" also refers to a few different concepts in the development world.

There are fuzzy boundaries here, but they feel distinct to me:

- **System package management:** like `apt`, `brew`, `pacman`, etc.
- **Language package management:** like `npm`, `pip`, `gem`, etc.
- **Project package management:** like `asdf`, `rvm`, `pyenv`, etc.

The cool thing about `nix` is that it can do all of these things, and more!

### Basic Usage

If you're new to `nix`, the following commands should feel familiar:

```sh
# To search for a package
nix search nixpkgs firefox
# To install a package
nix-env --install firefox
# To uninstall a package
nix-env --uninstall firefox
```

Whenever you install packages via `nix`, the following things happen:

1. looks up package in `nixpkgs`.
2. builds the package in `/nix/store/`.
3. updates your `PATH` to include the package.

Do note that using `nix-env` to install packages it a bit of an anti-pattern.

You're opting out of the functional and declarative nature of `nix` by doing so.

Let's talk a bit about what that means.

### Functional Package Management

The functional nature of `nix` gives you three things:

1. **Reproducibility:** package versions, dependencies, configuration will always be the same.
2. **Isolation:** packages are installed in a way that they don't interfere with each other.
3. **Rollbacks:** if you install a package that breaks your system, you can roll back to a previous generation of your system configuration.

> Note that this is a bit of a simplification, but it should be enough to get you started.

Basically, when `nix` installs a package, the path the package is installed to is unique to that package and version.

This is done by hashing the package name, version, and dependencies together to create a unique path.

Because of this, you get some superpowers:

- You can have multiple versions of the same package installed at once.
- The current "state" of your system is managed via symlinks.
- Rolling back is just changing symlinks to point to a different version of the package.

> You can even "preview" or temporarily installing packages in a transient shell without impacting anything else.
>
> Try running `nix-shell -p <package>` to see what I mean!
>
> This throws you into a new `bash` shell with your package installed.

### Declarative Package Management

In addition to being functional, `nix` is also declarative.

Basically: you tell `nix` what you want, and it figures out how to get there.

There are two main mechanisms for doing this:

1. via a `shell.nix` file
2. via an experimental feature called `flakes`

### Nix Shells

You can think about a `shell.nix` file as a way to define a "project" or "environment" that you want to work in.

For example, if you're working on a project that requires `nodejs`, `python`, and `git`, you can create a `shell.nix` file that looks like this:

```nix
{ pkgs ? import <nixpkgs> {} }:

with pkgs; mkShell {
  buildInputs = [
    nodejs
    python3
    git
  ];
}
```

Then, when you run `nix-shell`, it will create a new shell with those packages installed.

You can also add environment variables, shell hooks, and other configuration to the `shell.nix` file.

> I'd recommend using [direnv](https://direnv.net/) and [lorri](https://github.com/nix-community/lorri) to automatically enter the shell whenever you `cd` into a directory with a `shell.nix`.

The issue with using this approach is that it relies on something called `channels`.

A channel is a way to point `nix` to a specific version of `nixpkgs`, which is the package repository for `nix`.

The problem is that channels are imperatively managed global state. If you update your channel, it will update all the packages in your system:

```sh
# List your channels (check channel versions, third party repos)
nix-channel --list
# Update your channels (like running apt-get update && apt-get upgrade)
nix-channel --update
```

Thankfully, `flakes` are the solution to this!

### Nix Flakes

`flakes` are a new way to manage `nix` packages and configurations.

The main differences for package management are:

1. They specify inputs, i.e. the repositories you want to use.
2. They come with a lock file that locks the exact versions of the packages you're using.

This means that any two people using the same `flake.nix` and `flake.lock` will get the same versions of the packages, regardless of what version of `nixpkgs` they have installed.

An example `flake.nix` file for installing packages might look like:

```nix
{
  inputs.nixpkgs.url = "github:NixOS/nixpkgs/nixos-unstable";

  outputs = { self, nixpkgs, ... }:
    let
      pkgs = import nixpkgs { system = "x86_64-linux"; };
    in
    {
      packages.x86_64-linux.default = pkgs.mkShell {
        buildInputs = [
          pkgs.firefox
          pkgs.git
        ];
      };
    };
}
```

This `flake.nix` file will create a shell with `firefox` and `git` installed, and the versions of those packages will be locked in the `flake.lock` file.

You can run `nix develop` to enter the shell, and `nix run` to run a command in the shell.

> Likewise, [direnv](https://direnv.net/) will automatically enter the shell whenever you `cd` into a directory with a `flake.nix`.
>
> This basically allows you to use `nix` as a replacement for `asdf`, `rvm`, `pyenv`, etc.

That leads us nicely on to the next topic: NixOS.

## The NixOS Operating System

Because the `nix` package manager can declaratively manage packages, it can also declaratively manage your entire system configuration.

This is the entire premise of NixOS, for example:

```nix
{ config, lib, pkgs, ... }:

{
  imports = [ hardware-configuration.nix ];

  environment.systemPackages = with pkgs; [ firefox git ];
  networking.hostName = "my-hostname";
  services.sshd.enable = true;
}
```

This `configuration.nix` file will install `firefox` and `git`, set the hostname to `my-hostname`, and enable the SSH daemon.

Just like the package management examples, this builds your new system configuration into the `/nix/store/` and symlinks the current state into `/etc/`.

The `nixos-rebuild switch` command will then apply the configuration and update your system.

> Note: `nixos-rebuild` is a bit of a misnomer, as it doesn't actually rebuild your entire system every time you run it.
>
> It will only rebuild the parts of your system that have changed, and it will use the cached versions of the packages if they haven't changed.

Because `nix-lang` is a fully-fledged programming language, you can extend or abstract your config via modules.

Some modules I recommend include:

- [home-manager](https://home-manager.dev/) for declarative dotfiles.
- [nix-darwin](https://github.com/LnL7/nix-darwin) to manage MacOS declaratively.

> Using modules, I've been able to abstract and share modules between my laptops, workstations, home servers, and even my family's machines.
>
> I can even push updates to my modules and update my family's machines remotely.
>
> Check out [my dotfiles](https://github.com/vereis/nix-config).

Because of how NixOS manages your system, you can also roll back to a previous generation of your system configuration with ease.

```sh
# List your generations
nixos-rebuild list-generations
# Rollback to a previous generation
nixos-rebuild switch --rollback
```

However, this leads to one little problem...

### The Filesystem Hierarchy Standard

The Filesystem Hierarchy Standard (FHS) is a set of guidelines that define the directory structure and directory contents in Unix-like operating systems.

The FHS defines where things should go on the filesystem, and gives some interoperability guarantees when it comes to installing packages.

> By this, I mean you can install a package from the internet (i.e. `curl | sh`) and expect it to work.
>
> Assuming you have the right dependencies installed, of course.

This... isn't the case with NixOS. There is no real `/bin`, `/lib`, etc. on NixOS.

Instead, everything is managed via the `/nix/store/` directory, which is symlinked into the filesystem as needed.

> Generally speaking, that means non-NixOS packages won't work out of the box, and you'll need to use `nix` to install them.
>
> You can use hacks like `steam-run` which provides a FHS-like environment for running non-NixOS packages, but YMMV.

The good news is that `nixpkgs` is the largest software repository in the world, and writing your own package definitions is pretty easy.

In my experience, I've never had to write a package definition. I have, however, had to write a few `nix` modules to manage services and configuration.

### Modules

On my various servers, one component I always reach for is a reverse proxy.

This is a great use case for NixOS modules, as I've written a simple module that:

1. Installs [nginx](https://www.nginx.com/).
2. Manages my firewall rules.
3. Generates reverse proxy rules for me.

It means that in any of my servers, I can configure a reverse proxy as simply as:

```nix
imports = [
  modules/services/proxy.nix
]

modules.proxy = {
  enable = true;
  openFirewall = true;
  proxies = {
    "sonarr.vereis.com" = 8989;
    "radarr.vereis.com" = 7878;
    "prowlarr.vereis.com" = 9696;
    "transmission.vereis.com" = 9091;
    "lidarr.vereis.com" = 8686;
    "readarr.vereis.com" = 8787;
    "printer.vereis.com" = 631;
  };
};
```

The implementation of the module is pretty simple too, as it's a simply wrapper around the standard `nginx` module in `nixpkgs`.

```nix
{ pkgs, lib, config, ... }:

with lib;
{
  options.modules.proxy = {
    enable = mkOption { type = types.bool; default = false; };
    openFirewall = mkOption { type = types.bool; default = false; };
    firewallPorts = mkOption { type = types.listOf types.port; default = [ 80 443 ]; };
    proxies = mkOption { type = types.attrsOf types.port; default = { }; };
  };

  config = mkIf config.modules.proxy.enable {
    networking.firewall.allowedTCPPorts = mkIf config.modules.proxy.openFirewall config.modules.proxy.firewallPorts;

    security.acme.acceptTerms = true;
    security.acme.defaults.email = "contact@vereis.com"

    services.nginx = {
      enable = true;
      virtualHosts =
        builtins.mapAttrs (host: port: {
          enableACME = true;
          forceSSL = true;
          locations."/".proxyPass = "http://127.0.0.1:${toString port}/";
        }) config.modules.proxy.proxies;
    };
  };
}
```

> One interesting thing to note is that `nix-lang` is lazily evaluated.
>
> If multiple modules set the same configuration, say, `allowedTCPPorts`, `nix` will merge them together into a single system config.

### Managing Multiple Machines

One of the great things about NixOS is the ability to manage and reuse your configuration across multiple machines.

> For this post, I'll be focusing on doing this with `flakes`.
>
> If you're not using `flakes`, you can still copy the module system I talk about later, but you'll need

For example, I have a few different machines:

- My main workstation `madoka` currently running Windows.
- My Dell XPS 15 `homura` running NixOS.
- My homelab server `kyubey` running NixOS.
- My MacBook Pro `iroha` running MacOS.
- My Surface Pro X `mami` running Windows ARM.

I use `nix` to manage all of these machines, and I can easily share my configuration between them.

Thanks to `WSL`, the configuration for all my Windows machines is practically the same as the configuration for my Linux machines.

And thanks to `nix-darwin`, I can use the same configuration for my MacOS machine.

You can check out what my top-level `flake.nix` looks like:

```nix
{
  description = "Vereis' NixOS configuration";

  inputs =
    {
      nixpkgs.url = "github:nixos/nixpkgs/nixos-unstable";
      nix-homebrew.url = "github:zhaofengli-wip/nix-homebrew";
      nix-darwin = {
        url = "github:LnL7/nix-darwin";
        inputs.nixpkgs.follows = "nixpkgs";
      };
      home-manager = {
        url = "github:nix-community/home-manager";
        inputs.nixpkgs.follows = "nixpkgs";
      };
      nixos-wsl = {
        url = "github:nix-community/NixOS-WSL";
        inputs.nixpkgs.follows = "nixpkgs";
      };
    };

  outputs = inputs @ { self, nixpkgs, nixos-wsl, home-manager, ... }:
    let
      username = "vereis";
    in
    {
      darwinConfigurations = (
        import ./machines/darwin { inherit (nixpkgs) lib; inherit inputs nixpkgs home-manager nix-darwin, nix-homebrew; }
      )
      nixosConfigurations = (
        import ./machines/linux { inherit (nixpkgs) lib; inherit inputs nixpkgs home-manager username; }
        import ./machines/windows { inherit (nixpkgs) lib; inherit inputs nixpkgs home-manager nixos-wsl username; }
      );
    };
}
```

> Note: when importing a directory, `nix` will assume the directory contains a `default.nix` file.

Here, you can see I'm importing:

- `nixpkgs` for the package repository.
- `nix-darwin` for managing MacOS.
- `nix-homebrew` for `brew` integration.
- `nixos-wsl` for managing WSL.
- `home-manager` for managing user configuration.

For my personal machines, I differentiate between `machines/` configuration, `modules/` configuration.

The former is responsible for configuring each machine, and is the entrypoint where I'll start pulling in modules.

The latter is where said modules live. I also differentiate between `home/` and `services/` modules which are normal applications versus services respectively.

That way, I can easily share modules between machines and reuse them as needed.

> Likewise, I tend to re-use my configs between machines so splitting it up makes that easier.

### Machine Configuration

The `default.nix` file in `machines/*` is responsible for delegating configuration based on hostname to a specific config.

```nix
{ lib, inputs, nixpkgs, nix-darwin, home-manager, nixos-wsl, username, ... }:

let
  system = "x86_64-linux";
  pkgs = import nixpkgs { inherit system; config.allowUnfree = true; };
  lib = nixpkgs.lib;
in
{
  madoka = lib.nixosSystem {
    inherit system;
    specialArgs = { inherit inputs username; };
    modules = [
      ./madoka
      ./configuration.nix
      nixos-wsl.nixosModules.wsl
      home-manager.nixosModules.home-manager {
        home-manager.useGlobalPkgs = true;
        home-manager.useUserPackages = true;
        home-manager.extraSpecialArgs = { inherit username; };
        home-manager.users.${username}.imports = [(import ./home.nix)] ++ [(import ./madoka/home.nix)];
      }
    ];
  };

  homura = lib.nixosSystem {
    inherit system;
    specialArgs = { inherit inputs username; };
    modules = [
      ./homura
      ./configuration.nix
      home-manager.nixosModules.home-manager {
        home-manager.useGlobalPkgs = true;
        home-manager.useUserPackages = true;
        home-manager.extraSpecialArgs = { inherit username; };
        home-manager.users.${username}.imports = [(import ./home.nix)] ++ [(import ./homura/home.nix)];
      }
    ];
  };

  kyubey = lib.nixosSystem {
    inherit system;
    specialArgs = { inherit inputs username; };
    modules = [
      ./kyubey
      ./configuration.nix
      home-manager.nixosModules.home-manager {
        home-manager.useGlobalPkgs = true;
        home-manager.useUserPackages = true;
        home-manager.extraSpecialArgs = { inherit username; };
        home-manager.users.${username}.imports = [(import ./home.nix)] ++ [(import ./kyubey/home.nix)];
      }
    ];
  };

  ...
}
```

> Note: I've omitted some of the boilerplate for brevity.
>
> In fact, the most recent version of my configuration simplifies this a little so check it out!

The key thing this does is import:

1. **Global system configuration:** `machines/*/configuration.nix`
    - Configures `nix` itself.
    - Configures timezone, locales, etc.
2. **Host system configuration:** `machines/*/$host/default.nix`
    - Configures services, hardware, kernel modules, etc.
    - Imports my `services` modules.
3. **Host user configuration:** `machines/*/$host/home.nix`
    - Configures user packages, dotfiles, etc.
    - Imports my `home` modules.

The most important part of my own config is the `home.nix` files per host, so let's get into that!

### Home Manager

As mentioned earlier, `home-manager` is a tool for managing your user configuration, dotfiles, and packages.

I use it to install any package that doesn't require a daemon or service to run.

When you use `home-manager` to install packages, you get access to declarative configuration, for example:

```nix
{ config, lib, pkgs, ... }:

with lib;
{
  options.modules.zsh = {
    enable = mkOption { type = types.bool; default = false; };
  };

  config = mkIf config.modules.zsh.enable {
    home.packages = with pkgs; [ zsh ];

    programs.zsh = {
      enable = true;

      autocd = true;
      enableCompletion = true;
      autosuggestion.enable = true;

      prezto = {
        enable = true;
        prompt.theme = "powerlevel10k";
        editor.keymap = "vi";
      };
  };
}
```

Installing a package is then as simple as importing your module and adding `modules.zsh.enable = true;` to your `configuration.nix` file.

You can also declaratively source files into your home directory if what you want to do is low-level or not supported by `home-manager`.

> You can use the following to find supported packages and configuration options! [Home Manager Search](https://mipmip.github.io/home-manager-option-search/).

For example, I might want my `neovim` config on hosts where I don't have access to `nix`, so I source it instead:

```nix
{ config, lib, pkgs, ... }:

with lib;
{
  options.modules.neovim = {
    enable = mkOption { type = types.bool; default = false; };
  };

  config = mkIf config.modules.neovim.enable {
    home.packages = with pkgs; [
      stylua sumneko-lua-language-server shellcheck shfmt
      vale deno nodePackages.prettier
    ];

    programs.fzf.enable = true;
    programs.fzf.enableZshIntegration = true;

    home.sessionVariables = {
      FZF_DEFAULT_COMMAND = "rg --files | sort -u";
      EDITOR = "nvim";
      VISUAL = "nvim";
    };

    home.file.".vale.ini".source = ./neovim/.vale.ini;
    home.file.".config/nvim/lua/config.lua".source = ./neovim/config.lua;
    home.file.".local/share/nvim/site/pack/packer/start/packer.nvim" = {
      source = builtins.fetchGit {
        url = "https://github.com/wbthomason/packer.nvim";
        ref = "master";
        rev = "afab89594f4f702dc3368769c95b782dbdaeaf0a";
      };
    };

    programs.neovim = {
      enable = true;

      viAlias = true;
      vimAlias = true;
      vimdiffAlias = true;

      withNodeJs = true;
      withPython3 = true;

      extraConfig = ''
      lua require('config')
      '';
    };
  };
}
```

You can see the `home.file."name".source = ...` syntax is used to copy files into the home directory.

This way I can keep specific dotfiles reusable outside of using `nix` -- not that I've ever needed this.

However, not everything can be installed via `home-manager`...

### Service Modules

If you need to install a service or daemon, you'll need to use `nixos` modules instead.

> Despite the name, `nixos` modules can be used on any system that uses `nix`, including MacOS and WSL.

My previously shared `proxy.nix` module above is a good example of this. Note that this is enabled the same way as `home/` modules,
namely:

```nix
imports = [
  modules/services/proxy.nix
]

modules.proxy = {
  enable = true;
  openFirewall = true;
  proxies = {
    "sonarr.vereis.com" = 8989;
    "radarr.vereis.com" = 7878;
    "prowlarr.vereis.com" = 9696;
    "transmission.vereis.com" = 9091;
    "lidarr.vereis.com" = 8686;
    "readarr.vereis.com" = 8787;
    "printer.vereis.com" = 631;
  };
};
```

## Superpowers

For me, the ability to manage my entire system configuration in a declarative way is the killer feature of `nix`.

The fact that it replaces the need for `asdf`, `rvm`, `pyenv`, etc. is just icing on the cake.

To end off this post, this is **all it takes** to bootstrap a new machine:

```sh
# Install Nix via Determinate Systems
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf -L https://install.determinate.systems/nix | sh -s -- install --determinate

# Temporarily install `git` so I can clone my dotfiles
nix-shell -p git

# Clone my dotfiles
git clone https://github.com/vereis/nix-config
cd nix-config
sudo nixos-rebuild switch --flake .#$HOSTNAME
```

If my projects or job have a `flake.nix` in them, entering those directories automatically bootstraps a dev environment for me.

And is **literally just works** no questions asked. I genuinely believe `nix` is the future.

I hope you try it out! If nothing else, it's a new thing to learn!
