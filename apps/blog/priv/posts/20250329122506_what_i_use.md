A lot of people ask me about my setup, and there's a wider community of people who [share their setups](https://uses.tech/) which seems fun! So here's mine.

My setup(s) don't tend to change too much, as I like to keep the hardware and software I use minimal and consistent. When I do change something, I'll keep this post updated!

That being said, I'm always open to trying new things, so if you have any suggestions, please let me know!

## Operating System

I use all three major operating systems (and I use them for more or less the same thing)! But at the moment I'm using `Windows 11 LTSC` as the OS for my primary workstation.

When I'm on the go, I either use my `M3 MacBook Pro 14` or my `XPS 13 Developer Edition` running `NixOS`.

Regardless of the OS, I tend to use a lot of the same software across all of them which I'll go into more detail about below. To faciliate this on Windows, I'll use [WSL\(2\)](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/) but historically have used [Cygwin](https://www.cygwin.com/).

On MacOS, I'll use [nix-darwin](https://github.com/nix-darwin/nix-darwin), and otherwise I'll use [NixOS](https://nixos.org/). As a result all my configuration can be found [on GitHub](https://github.com/vereis/nix-config).

Needless to say as a `nix` user, I use `nix` as a package manager across all three operating systems, and have a custom module that integrates with [winget](https://github.com/microsoft/winget-cli).

## Terminal

On MacOS and Linux, I'll use [wezterm](https://wezterm.org). On Windows I'll use Microsoft's [Windows Terminal](https://github.com/microsoft/terminal).

I tend to keep my terminal setup relatively minimal. The features I "hard"-require from my terminal emulator are:

- Ability to hide scrollbars, ideally also window decorations.
- Have configurable padding.
- Ligature and unicode support.

My preferred colorscheme right now is a modified [rosepine](https://rosepinetheme.com/) `main` with a darker background color.

Other than choosing my favourite font and colorscheme, my terminal setup is otherwise vanilla. I don't value features like tabs or splits as I either prefer having the OS-level window management or use a terminal multiplexer instead.

My current favourite font is [tamsyn](http://www.fial.com/~scott/tamsyn-font/) which I'll use in its `8x16r` variant. I'm also quite fond of [Fantasque Sans Mono](https://github.com/belluzj/fantasque-sans) but I prefer my fonts small, compact, and pixelated.

> Yes, I do indeed still use a bitmap font in `$CURRENT_YEAR` -- sometimes aesthetics are more important than readability!

## Shell

I use [zsh](https://www.zsh.org/) as my shell, with [prezto](https://github.com/sorin-ionescu/prezto) as a lightweight configuration framework, but again, my configuration is pretty light.

I use a few plugins to make my life easier:

- [zsh-autosuggestions](https://github.com/zsh-users/zsh-autosuggestions) for `fish`-like autosuggestions.
- [zsh-syntax-highlighting](https://github.com/zsh-users/zsh-syntax-highlighting) for syntax highlighting.
- [fzf](https://github.com/junegunn/fzf) for fuzzy finding through my history.

> You might ask why I don't just use `fish` if I like its features so much. I've tried `fish` a few times, but I always end up missing the POSIX compatibility of `zsh` and `bash`.
> I value the ability to write scripts that work on any system I'm on, and `fish`'s syntax is good enough to be annoying when I'm forced to not use it.

For my prompt, I use a lightly customized [powerlevel10k](https://github.com/romkatv/powerlevel10k) prompt primarily for its speed.

I don't really use any aliases or functions, as I prefer to keep my shell as close to the default as possible for interoperability reasons.

Every time I start a new shell, I start [zellij](https://zellij.dev/) which is a terminal multiplexer similar to `tmux` or `screen` but with a more modern and user-friendly interface.

Everything fancy is disabled, but I do use it for tabs, splits, and most importantly: floating windows.

## Editor

When I first started programming, I used `Notepad++` or `Notepad2` for Windows, and have tried various editors like `Sublimt Text` and `VSCode` but quite a few years ago I took the plunge and switched to `Vim` for all my editing needs.

Since then, I've been a long-term [Neovim](https://neovim.io/) user, primarily because it allows me to live in my terminal emulator as much as possible.

If you're interested, you can check out my [Neovim Configuration](https://github.com/vereis/nix-config/tree/master/modules/home/neovim/lua).

In short however, I really rely on the following plugins:

- [Lazy](https://github.com/folke/lazy.nvim) to manage my plugins.
- [Mason](https://github.com/williamboman/mason-lspconfig.nvim) to manage my LSP configuration.
- [Telescope](https://github.com/nvim-telescope/telescope.nvim) with `fzf` integration for fuzzy finding.
- [git-signs](https://github.com/lewis6991/gitsigns.nvim) for `git` integration.
- [neotree](https://github.com/nvim-neo-tree/neo-tree.nvim) for a file tree.
- [copilot.vim](https://github.com/github/copilot.vim) just for fun.
- Lots of [tpope](https://github.com/tpope)'s plugins.

> I intend on playing around with [oil.nvim](https://github.com/stevearc/oil.nvim) soon too, which lets you edit the filesystem like any standard buffer.

Weirdly, I don't tend to use splits much, and I'm weaning myself off of using (the built in) tabs too. I manage my buffers as though they were tabs and primarily use `:telecope` or LSP goto-definition to navigate between them.

## Browser

I currently use [qutebrowser](https://www.qutebrowser.org/) which is an extremely configurable, minimalistic browser built on top of `QtWebEngine` that has first-class `vim` keybindings.

It isn't perfect, many sites don't render correctly, but I find it to be the best browser for my workflow. I use it for everything from browsing the web to watching videos.

I don't really use any plugins/extensions, paying for a `YouTube Premium` subscription helps! Honestly the only feature I need is the ability to have sidebar tabs and `vim` keybindings.

For videos that are locked behind DRM, I'll use whatever browser comes pre-installed on the OS I'm using.

## Other Apps

I don't tend to use many other apps. For work I'll usually use `Slack` for instant messaging, `Teams` for video conferencing.

Otherwise I'll use `Spotify` for music, `Steam` for games, `Discord` for hanging out with friends, and pay for `Netflix`, `Amazon Prime`, `Crunchyroll`, and `Disney+` for watching TV shows and movies.

I also subscribe to [khaudio](https://khaudio.com/) for high-quality music, and run my own [Jellyfin](https://jellyfin.org/) server for watching my own media.

## Backup Strategy

The amount of "state" I have on my devices is minimal -- any state is assumed to be ephemeral and can be recreated at any time.

Important files tend to be stored in a `git` repository, documents and images are either sync'd to a machine in my homelab or stored in Google Drive.

I'd heavily recommend reading [Erase your darlings](https://grahamc.com/blog/erase-your-darlings/) which is the blog post that inspired me to adopt this strategy.

## Desk Setup

I collect keyboards, and as such, I switch between them fairly regularly. I'm currently switching between a salvaged beige `HHKB Pro 2` with `JIS` keycaps, and a `F62 Kishsaver` with a HHKB layout and `JIS` keycaps.

My mouse of choice would be a `Logitech MX Master 3` but I'm currently using a [Lofree Touch](https://www.lofree.co/products/lofree-touch-pbt-wireless-mouse) because it's cute and matches my keyboards.

My video conferencing setup is pretty simple. I use an [Elgato Facecam Pro](https://www.elgato.com/en/gaming/facecam) for video, and a [Blue Yeti](https://www.bluedesigns.com/products/yeti/) for audio.

If I'm using headphones, I'll use a pair of [Sony WH-1000XM4](https://www.sony.co.uk/electronics/headband-headphones/wh-1000xm4) but honestly I prefer to use my speakers unless my surroundings are too noisy or if I'm on the go.

For the desk itself, I have a [Fully Jarvis Walnut](https://www.fully.com/jarvis-adjustable-height-desk-bamboo.html) standing desk with an [Herman Miller Aeron](https://www.hermanmiller.com/products/seating/office-chairs/aeron-chairs/) chair. I've used a lot of chairs in the past, but the Aeron is the only one that I can literally sit in for 12 hours a day without any discomfort.

I've recently gotten a cheap treadmill to put under my desk, and as a result I've been walking for a few hours a day while I work. It's been great for my health and productivity!
