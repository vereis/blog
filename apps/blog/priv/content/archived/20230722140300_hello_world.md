Ahoy~!! I'm `vereis`!!

I'm a London-based `Tech Lead` working for a startup that builds software for veterinarians. We're trying to save vets time so they can focus on what they do best: helping animals.

I read `Computer Science & Artificial Intelligence` at the [University of Kent](https://kent.ac.uk) and I graduated in 2018.

Since then I've had the pleasure of being able to focus on "niche" technologies like [Erlang](https://erlang.org) and [Elixir](https://elixir-lang.org) alongside anything else that tickles my fancy.

Outside of programming and technology, I'm a **huge** foodie, a cook, and I'm a self-proclaimed tea snob.

## Background

I'm a self-taught programmer who started programming to make video games.

I started with [GameMaker](https://www.yoyogames.com/gamemaker) when I was seven, where I (very inefficiently) taught myself the basics of programming.

I've always seen myself first and foremost as a `problem solver`, so trying to be a "jack of all trades" has always appealed to me.

As a result, I've dabbled in frontend development, backend development, game development, DevOps, and even a bit of embedded systems programming.

Nowadays, my go-to tech stack generally includes:

- [Elixir](https://elixir-lang.org)
- [Erlang](https://erlang.org)
- [PostgreSQL](https://postgresql.org) or [SQLite](https://sqlite.org)
- [Svelte](https://svelte.dev) or [React](https://reactjs.org)
- [Tailscale](https://tailscale.com)
- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com)
- [Nix](https://nixos.org)

## This Website

This website is currently built with `Phoenix LiveView` and `SQLite` (using [LiteFS](https://fly.io/docs/litefs/)) on [fly.io](https://fly.io).

The CSS theme is heavily inspired by the beautiful terminal user interfaces created by [charmbracelet](https://charmbracelet.com).

The font used throughout the site is [Maple Mono](https://github.com/subframe7536/maple-font).

My goal for this website is to have a place where I can share my thoughts, opinions, experiments, and other random musings with the world.

Feel free to explore the site!
