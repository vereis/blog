I used to own a `Surface Pro 9` with a `SQ3` processor, but I gifted it to my parents.

Today, he was having device compatibility issues -- probably due to the lacking drivers for the `ARM` Windows... -- so we agreed to swap devices!

As a result, I have the (nowadays) rare opportunity to set up a fresh development environment for `Windows 11`.

This `Surface Pro 9` will likely just be the machine I use whenever:

- Me and my mentor decide to co-work from one another's homes.
- Me and the rest of the team have a co-working day in London.
- I'm travelling.

So it needs to be able to do everything I'd normally do on my workstation, just on the go!

Since I'll need to go through the full reinstallation process, I though I'd document my process for anyone trying to set up a `UNIX` development environment for Windows!

## Installing Windows 11

I've decided to install `Windows 11` instead of another operating system because:

- I intend to play some visual novels on it.
- It's the most compatible with the hardware.
- The screen is beautiful and Netflix at 4K is a treat.
- The battery life is great, and I want to keep it that way.
- The Linux experience on Surface devices is not great... and this is `ARM` to boot.

My development environment doesn't really differ much regardless of the host operating system too, so no compromises there.

### Choosing your version

There are a few versions of `Windows 11` available.

To boil it down, you have:

- **Home**: The "standard" version, which is what most people will use.
- **Pro**: The "professional" version, which adds some features:
  - `BitLocker` encryption.
  - Group Policy Management.
  - `Hyper-V` virtualization.
  - Windows Sandbox.
- **Pro for Workstations**: The "workstation" version, doesn't add much for me.
  - `ReFS` file system support which is cool but...
  - Faster file sharing over `SMB`.
  - More CPU and RAM support (irrelevant, for me).
- **Enterprise**: The "business" version, which is not available for consumers.
  - It has all the features of `Pro` and more, but you need a volume license to get it.
- **Education**: The "education" version, which is similar to `Enterprise` but for schools and universities.

Of these, I'd lean towards `Pro` or `Enterprise` if you can get it.

One annoying thing about `Windows 11` is that it comes with a lot of bloat, ads, and telemetry on practically every version except `Enterprise` (and maybe `Education`).

> The amount of times I've had my machine forced to restart in the middle of a workday is ridiculous.

> Then, my settings get reset, and I have to spend time reconfiguring everything...

Thankfully, as part of the `Enterprise` version, you can use a variant called [`LTSC`](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/whats-new/whats-new-windows-10-version-1607#enterprise-ltsc) (Long-Term Servicing Channel) which is a version of `Windows` that:

- Is practically the same as `Pro` or `Enterprise`.
- Comes with minimal telemetry.
- Has no bloatware (doesn't even come with the Microsoft Store).
- Only gets security updates, no feature updates.
- Longer support lifecycle (10 years).
- Doesn't force you to have a Microsoft account.

I highly recommend using `LTSC` if you can get it.

> I wouldn't recommend using non-official channels to get `LTSC`, but you can get an evaluation ISO [here](https://massgrave.dev/windows_11_links).

If you're interested in getting `LTSC`, the easiest ways to do that without breaking the bank or relying on unofficial channels are:

1. Get a `Volume License` from Microsoft
    - This is the official way to get it, but you'll need 5+ licenses.
    - Between $300 and $500 per license.
2. Buying through a Volume License Reseller
3. Get a Cloud Solution Provider Subscription (CSP) from Microsoft ($20-30).
4. Get the `IoT Enterprise LTSC` version, which is the same as `LTSC` but for IoT devices.
    - You have to accept the `IoT` license terms, which are a bit more restrictive.
    - You can just buy it for a single device.
    - Between $100 and $200 per license.

Once you have your license, download the ISO. For this post I'll be using [massgrave](https://massgrave.dev/genuine-installation-media) to get the `LTSC` ISO for convenience.

### Burning the ISO

For burning the ISO, I personally recommend using [Rufus](https://rufus.ie/), which is a free and open-source tool for creating bootable USB drives.

You can install it via `winget` too if you're already using Windows:

```sh
winget.exe install Rufus.Rufus
```

Then, once you have it installed, you just:

1. Open Rufus.
2. Select your USB drive.
3. Select the `Windows 11 LTSC` ISO you downloaded.
4. Press `Start`.

I'd recommend setting the following options too to make everything just work upon installation:

> *Totally optional, but it makes things easier.*

### Installation

Find a guide on how to boot into a USB drive on your device.

Once you boot into the USB drive, you'll be greeted with the `Windows 11` installation screen.

Simply follow the prompts from your installer and you'll have `Windows 11` installed in no time!

> Note: If you're on an `ARM` device, you may need to disable `Secure Boot` in your BIOS/UEFI settings to boot the installer.

Once the installation is complete, you'll be prompted to set up your user account and preferences.

After installation, I always recommend making sure you've got the latest `Windows 11` updates installed before proceeding with any further setup.

## Development Environment

Now that we have `Windows 11` installed, let's set up the development environment!

All the tools I use as part of my development environment are `CLI` or `TUI` based, so the main choice I need to make is which terminal emulator to use.

### Terminal Emulator

Prior to Microsoft releasing [Windows Terminal](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/terminal/), I used to find the terminal experience on Windows to be quite lacking.

There are a few options such as:

- [ConEmu](https://conemu.github.io/) and [Cmder](https://cmder.net/).
- [Warp](https://warp.dev/) (which people use... for some reason).
- [Mintty](https://mintty.github.io/).

But nowadays, I find that `Windows Terminal` is the best option for most people.

> In my experience, `mintty` works really well, at least it did back in the [Cygwin](https://www.cygwin.com/) days.
>
> My main issue with it is that it doesn't support terminal padding, which is a must for me.
>
> There may have also been some issues with `Unicode` support, but I can't remember exactly.

> `ConEmu` has a lot of configuration options, but I found performance **extremely** lacking.

I install the beta version of `Windows Terminal` via `winget`:

```sh
winget.exe install Microsoft.WindowsTerminal.Preview
```

Once that's set up, you can configure it quite easily via pressing `Ctrl + ,` or going to the settings menu.

My only complaint with `Windows Terminal` is the awkward `JSON` configuration file, but I just set up padding, choose a font, colorscheme, and I'm good to go.

### Windows Subsystem for Linux

I do all my development work in a `Linux` environment.

Microsoft have a great tool for this called the [Windows Subsystem for Linux](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/), or `WSL` for short.

Think about it like running a super lightweight, well-integrated `Linux` virtual machine inside of `Windows`.

You can install it by running:

```sh
wsl.exe --install --no-distribution
```
> Note: I'm planning on using `NixOS` as my distribution. This isn't available by default, so I need to install it manually later.
>
> Omitting the `--no-distribution` flag will install the default distribution, which is `Ubuntu`.

Unfortunately, you need to reboot after installing `WSL`. Once that's done, we can move on to installing `NixOS`!

### Installing NixOS

The [NixOS WSL](https://github.com/nix-community/NixOS-WSL) project is a community-maintained project that provides a `NixOS` distribution for `WSL`.

If you're following along on an `x86_64` machine, you can set it up super easily.

Download the [latest release](https://github.com/nix-community/NixOS-WSL/releases/latest) and run it -- literally double click it!

> This is a new feature added as part of `WSL 2.4.4`.
>
> If you don't have this version at least, you can import via `wsl.exe --import` instead.

However, since I'm on an `ARM` device, I'll need to build the `NixOS` image myself.

#### Building NixOS for ARM

The easiest way to build the `NixOS WSL` image for `ARM` is to:

1. Temporarily install `Ubuntu` on `WSL`.
2. Install [Nix](https://nixos.org/download.html).
3. Clone the [repo](https://github.com/nix-community/NixOS-WSL).
4. Update the top level `flake.nix` to target `aarch64-linux`.
5. Do a `nix build`.
6. Import the resulting image into `WSL`.

Assuming not much changes in the future, you can just run the following commands:

```sh
wsl.exe --install # Defaults to Ubuntu
wsl.exe # Runs the default distribution, which is Ubuntu
```

Now just set a username and password for the `Ubuntu` user, then run the following commands:

```sh
curl -fsSL https://install.determinate.systems/nix | sh -s -- install --determinate
. /nix/var/nix/profiles/default/etc/profile.d/nix.sh
cd ~
git clone https://github.com/nix-community/NixOS-WSL.git
cd NixOS-WSL/
sed -i 's/system = "x86_64/system = "aarch64/g' flake.nix
nix build .#nixosConfigurations.default.config.system.build.tarballBuilder
sudo ./result/bin/nixos-wsl-tarball-builder
explorer.exe .
```

Double click, or `wsl.exe --import --from-file ...` and you should be able to boot into `NixOS`!

```sh
exit # Quit Ubuntu
wsl.exe -d NixOS
sudo nix-channel --update && sudo nixos-rebuild switch
```

If that works, you should now have a working `NixOS` installation on `WSL`!

> You can remove the `Ubuntu` distribution if you want.
>
> Run `wsl.exe --unregister Ubuntu` to do so.
>
> This should set `NixOS` as the default distribution automatically. If it doesn't, or you want to keep `Ubuntu` around, you can run `wsl.exe -s NixOS` to set it as the default.

### Pulling my Configuration

Now that we have `NixOS` installed, we can pull my configuration from GitHub.

I keep my config in [this repo](https://github.com/vereis/nix-config).

If you have your own configuration, you probably know what to do. If you don't, this probably isn't the right place to start.

> If you're new to `NixOS`, I recommend starting with `flakes` enabled.
>
> Check the `NixOS WSL` [manual](https://nix-community.github.io/NixOS-WSL/how-to/nix-flakes.html) for a starting point.
>
> Otherwise, check out my [post on NixOS](/posts/nixos_kool_aid) for more notes.

For my setup, I just run the following commands:

```sh
nix-shell -p git
mkdir -p ~/git/vereis
cd ~/git/vereis
git clone https://github.com/vereis/nix-config.git
cd nix-config
sudo nixos-rebuild switch --flake .#homura
wsl.exe --shutdown
```
> Yes, all my machines are named after [Madoka Magica](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Madoka_Magica) characters.

The next time you run `wsl.exe`, all the packages and configurations I need will installed including:

- `nvim` with my configuration.
- `zsh` with my configuration.
- `git` with my configuration.
- `docker` enabled.

![image](../assets/nix_wsl_arm.webp)
> Everything just works on boot! Amazing!!

I manage project dependencies on a project-by-project basis with `flakes`, so I don't need to install anything else.

> Honestly, projects bootstrapping themselves on `cd` is the best thing ever.
>
> Definitely recommend [direnv](https://direnv.net/) for this, with their `nix` integration.

### Minor Tweaks

#### Changing Login Dir

By default, `WSL` will start in your **Windows** home directory.

I actually can't understand why this is the case, but you can change it three ways:

1. Running `wsl.exe ~` instead of `wsl.exe`.
2. Changing the `Starting Directory` in the `Windows Terminal` settings.
3. Update your `wsl.conf` file to set the default user home directory.

I personally just update the `Windows Terminal` settings to point to my `NixOS` home directory, which is `\\wsl$\NixOS\home\vereis`.

### Conclusion

And that's it! You now have a fully functional `NixOS` development environment running on `WSL2` on `ARM`.

This setup should allow you to do everything you need to do on the go, with the added benefit of having a `UNIX` development environment.

Hopefully, this post has been helpful in getting you started with setting up your own `NixOS` development environment on `Windows 11`!

Doubly so if you're on `ARM` like me!
